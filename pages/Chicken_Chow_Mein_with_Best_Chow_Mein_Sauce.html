    <b>
        Cook noodles according to package instructions, set aside. 
    </b>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <b>
Heat a large wok or pan. Add a bit of oil to the pan and cook chicken until it’s golden brown. Remove chicken and set aside.

    </b>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <b>
Add carrots, cabbage and pressed garlic and saute for a few minutes until veggies are slightly softened. 

    </b>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <b>
        Add chicken back to the pan, followed by cooked noodles and pour the sauce right on top. Cook for about 2 minutes, distributing all that saucy goodness around evenly.
