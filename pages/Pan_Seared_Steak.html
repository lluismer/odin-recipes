    <h1>How to do Steak</h1>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <b>
Pat dry use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.    </b>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <b>
Season generously just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.
    </b>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <b>
Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.

    </b>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <b>
Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).

    </b>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <b>
Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).

    </b>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <b>
Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
